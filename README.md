# LUS_Project1

First project for Language Understanding System course about *Concept tagging*.
The dataset used is about films.

## How to use

You have to have installed python3, opengrm and openfst.
Simply run `make automaton` and the script will generate a lexicon file (`lex.txt`), a tag lexicon (`tags.lex.txt`) and an automaton (`automaton.fst`) for concept tagging with _IOB_ tags. If you have a sentence modeled with an FSA you can tag it. Run `make clean` to delete all files generated by the script.
To test tag your own sentence run `make tag` after having built the model.
ATM the model is built... next is to evaluate it on the test set, than to further improve it.
